| Presence, Time & Simplicity | Everything is flowing -- going somewhere, animals and so-called lifeless rocks as well as water. Thus the snow flows fast or slow in grand beauty-making glaciers and avalanches; the air in majestic floods carrying minerals, plant leaves, seeds, spores, with streams of music and fragrance; water streams carrying rocks... While the stars go streaming through space pulsed on and on forever like blood...in Nature's warm heart. |

| Presence, Time & Simplicity | I beg you to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign tongue.

Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer. |

And so I pretended not to hear her and went out to get an envelope because I’m going to have a hell of a good time in the process of buying one envelope. I meet a lot of people. And I see some great looking babies. And a fire engine goes by. And I give them the thumbs up. And I’ll ask a woman what kind of dog that is…we’re dancing animals. You know, we love to move around. |
| Presence, Time & Simplicity | The Christian is, I believe, one who sacrifices the half-truth for the sake of the whole truth, who abandons an incomplete and imperfect concept of life for a life that is integrated, unified, and structurally perfect. Yet this entrance into such a life is not the end of the journey, but only the beginning. A long journey must follow: an anguished and sometimes perilous exploration. Of all Christians the monk is, or at least should be, the most professional of such explorers. His journey takes him through deserts and paradises for which no maps exist. He lives in strange areas of solitude, of emptiness, of joy, of perplexity and admiration |
